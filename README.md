this is a ci/cd solution. it works using a script written in yaml that creates a temporary linux based container that is then used to check the code structure and then testing it's functionality and finaly deploying the package.

this practice make the software lifecycle more efficient by reducing human error, automating important processes, and making version control easier by minimizing down time between diffrent builds.

furthermore

everytime a new commit is done to this project, the workflow is invoked and runs, it first check the code "cleanliness" and best practices using a tool called flake8, afterwards pytest runs in order to test the functions. note every step must be completed succsessfuly in order to continue to the next one.
lastly it uploads the new build to jfrog artifactory as part of a cd solution.
